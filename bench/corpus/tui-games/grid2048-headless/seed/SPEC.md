# `2048` — headless replay specification

A game of 2048 driven by a script of move commands and reported as one line of
JSON. There is no terminal, no timing and no automated player anywhere in this
specification: a replay is a pure function of a seed and a script, so two
implementations that both follow this document produce the same bytes.

Numbered requirements are the contract. Where a constant or a formula is given,
that constant or that formula is the one to use.

## 1. Modules

The work tree is flat and every module is imported, never executed.

| Module | Exports | State |
|---|---|---|
| `src/rng.py` | `SplitMix64` | written |
| `src/board.py` | `SIZE`, `blank`, `copy`, `empty_cells`, `max_tile`, `count_empty` | written |
| `src/summary.py` | `KEY_ORDER`, `SCHEMA`, `to_line` | written |
| `src/session.py` | `DIRECTIONS`, `Session` | written |
| `src/replay.py` | `ScriptError`, `parse`, `replay`, `fields` | written |
| `src/moves.py` | `slide_left`, `apply` | partial |
| `src/undo.py` | `CAPACITY`, `UndoStack` | partial |

`NOTES.md` says which requirements the two partial modules do not yet meet.

## 2. Board

**R1.** The board is 4x4. `grid[r][c]` uses row index `r` = 0..3 top to bottom
and column index `c` = 0..3 left to right, so `grid[0][0]` is the top-left cell.
A cell holds either `0` or a power of two at least `2`.

**R2.** Serialised, the board is a 4-element array of 4-element arrays, outer
index `r`, inner index `c`, values as plain integers — tile face values, not
exponents.

## 3. The generator

**R3.** All randomness comes from SplitMix64 seeded with the seed the session
was built with. No other source of randomness may influence game state. The
generator is exactly:

```
state : u64  = seed
next() -> u64:
    state = (state + 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15) mod 2**64
    z = state
    z = ((z XOR (z >> 30)) * 0xBF58476D1CE4E5B9) mod 2**64
    z = ((z XOR (z >> 27)) * 0x94D049BB133111EB) mod 2**64
    return z XOR (z >> 31)
```

All shifts are logical on unsigned 64-bit values and all arithmetic wraps.

**R4.** The first four `next()` outputs, in hexadecimal:

| seed | out 1 | out 2 | out 3 | out 4 |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0 | `E220A8397B1DCDAF` | `6E789E6AA1B965F4` | `06C45D188009454F` | `F88BB8A8724C81EC` |
| 1 | `910A2DEC89025CC1` | `BEEB8DA1658EEC67` | `F893A2EEFB32555E` | `71C18690EE42C90B` |
| 42 | `BDD732262FEB6E95` | `28EFE333B266F103` | `47526757130F9F52` | `581CE1FF0E4AE394` |

## 4. Spawning

**R5.** A spawn consumes exactly **two** draws, always both, always in this
order. Draw `a`; the spawn cell is `empty_cells(grid)[a mod k]`, where `k` is
the number of empty cells. Draw `b`; the spawned value is `4` when
`b mod 10 == 0` and `2` otherwise. The second draw is taken even when `k` is 1.
Nothing else may consume draws.

**R6.** A new session starts from an all-zero board and performs exactly two
spawns. The resulting boards, which are worth checking before anything else:

| seed | initial grid |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 1 | `[[2,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]` |
| 2 | `[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0]]` |
| 3 | `[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0],[0,2,0,0]]` |
| 7 | `[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,2],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]` |
| 20 | `[[0,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[2,0,0,0]]` |

After a legal move exactly one spawn occurs. No spawn occurs on a rejected move,
on an undo, or at any other time.

## 5. Move semantics

**R7.** `slide_left(row)` returns the row after a LEFT move and the score that
move adds:

1. Collect the row's non-zero values into a list `v`, preserving left-to-right
   order.
2. Walk `v` from index 0 with a cursor `i`. If `v[i] == v[i+1]`, emit the single
   tile `2 * v[i]`, add `2 * v[i]` to the gain, and advance `i` by 2. Otherwise
   emit `v[i]` and advance `i` by 1.
3. Right-pad the emitted list with zeros to length 4.

That gives leftmost-pair-first merging, at most one merge per tile per move, and
no tile produced by a merge may merge again in the same move.

**R8.** `apply(grid, direction)` expresses all four directions through
`slide_left`. `R` is `L` on the reversed row, reversed back. `U` is `L` on each
column read top to bottom, column index order 0..3. `D` is `U` on the reversed
column, reversed back. The merge therefore always favours the pair nearest the
direction of travel.

**R9.** This table is exact. Each row is one line before and after; "gain" is
the score that line adds.

| line | after `L` | gain | after `R` | gain |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---- | ------------- | ---- |
| `[2,2,2,2]` | `[4,4,0,0]` | 8 | `[0,0,4,4]` | 8 |
| `[4,4,4,4]` | `[8,8,0,0]` | 16 | `[0,0,8,8]` | 16 |
| `[2,2,4,0]` | `[4,4,0,0]` | 4 | `[0,0,4,4]` | 4 |
| `[4,4,8,0]` | `[8,8,0,0]` | 8 | `[0,0,8,8]` | 8 |
| `[4,4,2,2]` | `[8,4,0,0]` | 12 | `[0,0,8,4]` | 12 |
| `[2,0,2,4]` | `[4,4,0,0]` | 4 | `[0,0,4,4]` | 4 |
| `[4,2,2,4]` | `[4,4,4,0]` | 4 | `[0,4,4,4]` | 4 |
| `[8,4,4,2]` | `[8,8,2,0]` | 8 | `[0,8,8,2]` | 8 |
| `[8,8,8,0]` | `[16,8,0,0]` | 16 | `[0,0,8,16]` | 16 |
| `[2,4,2,4]` | `[2,4,2,4]` | 0 | `[2,4,2,4]` | 0 |
| `[0,0,2,2]` | `[4,0,0,0]` | 4 | `[0,0,0,4]` | 4 |
| `[0,2,0,2]` | `[4,0,0,0]` | 4 | `[0,0,0,4]` | 4 |

`[4,4,8,0]` and `[8,8,8,0]` are the no-double-merge cases. Get them wrong and
every downstream number is wrong.

**R10.** A move is **legal** exactly when applying R7 and R8 changes at least
one cell. An illegal move is **rejected**: the grid, the score and the move
counter are unchanged, no spawn occurs, and `rejected` increments by one. This
one rule also covers the dead board — when no direction is legal, every move
command is a rejection.

**R11.** The score starts at 0 and rises only by merge gains. Spawning adds
nothing.

**R12.** A game is **over** when none of the four directions is legal. Reaching
2048 does not end it.

## 6. Rewind

**R13.** Undo is a full state rewind with a LIFO stack of at least
`src.undo.CAPACITY` entries. Immediately before a legal move is applied, a
snapshot of `(grid, score, move counter, generator state)` is pushed. Restoring
pops the newest snapshot and writes back all four fields, the generator's state
included. When the stack is at capacity a push discards the oldest entry.

**R14.** Restoring from an empty stack changes no game state and reports that
there was nothing to restore. An undo is not a move: it does not spawn and does
not touch `rejected`. Because the generator's state is restored, replaying the
same direction after an undo must reproduce the identical spawn — an undo may
not be used to re-roll one.

## 7. Counters

**R15.** `moves` is the move counter **of the current state**: a legal move adds
one and an undo subtracts one, because an undo restores the counter the snapshot
carried. `rejected`, `undos` and `ai_moves` are cumulative for the whole session
and no undo rewinds them. `undos` counts undo commands issued, no-ops on an
empty stack included. `ai_moves` is always `0`: this specification has no
automated player.

## 8. Script format

**R16.** A script is UTF-8 text, one command per line. A `#` begins a comment
and the rest of the line is discarded; blank and whitespace-only lines are
ignored. A command is a token, optionally followed by whitespace and a positive
decimal repeat count, so `L` is one left move and `L 3` is three. Tokens are
case-insensitive and are exactly `L`, `R`, `U`, `D` (move), `Z` (undo) and `Q`
(stop). Anything else, and a repeat count that is not a positive decimal
integer, raises `ScriptError` naming the line number.

**R17.** `Q` stops processing immediately. End of file stops processing the same
way, and the two differ only in the resulting status.

## 9. Summary

`fields(session)` returns the summary as a `dict` and `src.summary.to_line`
serialises it in `KEY_ORDER`, compact, with no trailing newline.

| key | type | meaning |
| --- | ---- | ------- |
| `schema` | string | always `src.summary.SCHEMA` |
| `seed` | int | the seed the session was built with |
| `grid` | int[4][4] | the final board, per R2 |
| `score` | int | the final score, per R11 |
| `moves` | int | the move counter, per R15 |
| `rejected` | int | rejected move commands, cumulative |
| `undos` | int | undo commands issued, cumulative |
| `ai_moves` | int | always 0 |
| `max_tile` | int | the largest tile on the final grid |
| `empty` | int | zero cells on the final grid |
| `won` | bool | whether `max_tile` is at least 2048 |
| `status` | string | `game_over`, `quit` or `script_end` |
| `rng_state` | string | the generator's state word at exit, 16 uppercase hex digits, zero-padded |

**R18.** The status resolves in this order: if no direction is legal on the
final board it is `game_over`, however processing ended; otherwise, if
processing stopped on a `Q` it is `quit`; otherwise it is `script_end`.

**R19.** Given the same seed and the same script the line is byte-identical
across runs. `rng_state` is in the summary precisely so a drifting generator is
caught immediately rather than fifty moves later.

## 10. Out of scope

There is no interactive mode, no terminal handling, no colouring, no key
bindings and no automated player: no expectimax search, no bitboard, no
heuristic and no transposition table. Nothing in the work tree may sleep, read
the wall clock, read a real random source, or open a socket.
